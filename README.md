# RPC++
RPC++ is a tool for Discord RPC (Rich Presence) to let your friends know about your Linux system


## Installing requirements
### Arch based systems
```sh
pacman -S unzip
```
### Debian based systems
```sh
apt install unzip -y
```

## Building
**GNU Make**, and **Discord Game SDK** are **required**. To see more information about setting up Discord Game SDK, see [DISCORD.md](./DISCORD.md)

If you have Arch Linux, please read the AUR section.

To build RPC++, use the command: 
```sh
make
```

## Installing & Running
To install RPC++, run the this command:
```sh
sudo make install
```
You can run the app from any directory with
```sh

To run manually (without installing) you need to start `./build/rpcpp` with the variables `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$(pwd)/lib"`

## Will you add more application/distro support?
Sure, let me know on my [discord server](https://grial.tech/discord)! Though I'm pretty sure Discord has a limit of images that can be uploaded per application.

## Contributing
You can make pull requests, to improve the code or if you have new ideas, but I don't think I will update the code very often.
